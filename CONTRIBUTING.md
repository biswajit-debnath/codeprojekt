## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project Locally

This project uses Firebase for backend services. To run it on your machine, you'll need to use your own Firebase keys.

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2.  In the project, create a new **Web App** (`</>`) to get your `firebaseConfig` keys.

3.  In your code editor, create a new file in the root folder named `.env.local`.

4.  Copy and paste your keys into the `.env.local` file like this:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET_HERE
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID_HERE
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID_HERE
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID_HERE
    ```

5.  In the Firebase Console, go to "Build" and enable **Authentication** (using Email/Password) and **Storage**.

6.  Finally, install the packages and run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
