## 🧩 Contribution Guidelines

- Make sure your PR is **small and focused** on one issue or improvement.  
- Check if your code passes existing linting or formatting rules.  
- If you're fixing a bug or adding a feature, please include a **short description** in the PR.  
- Link any related **issue** using `Fixes #issue_number` in your PR description.  
- Only meaningful contributions will be accepted — typo fixes in non-code files (like README) won’t count toward Hacktoberfest unless they improve clarity or fix a real issue.
